{"name":"Hunalign4J","tagline":"A package of utility functions in Java to wrap hunalign","body":"### What is Hunalign4J?\r\nHunalign4j is a java wrapper for the original Hunalign project which was written in C++.\r\nHunalign aligns bilingual text on the sentence level. Its input is\r\ntokenized and sentence-segmented text in two languages. In the\r\nsimplest case, its output is a sequence of bilingual sentence pairs\r\n(bisentences).\r\n\r\nLike most sentence aligners, hunalign does not deal with changes of\r\nsentence order: it is unable to come up with crossing alignments, i.e.,\r\nsegments A and B in one language corresponding to segments B’ A’ in the\r\nother language.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing Hungarian-specific in hunalign, the name simply\r\nreflects the fact that it is part of the hun* NLP toolchain.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
