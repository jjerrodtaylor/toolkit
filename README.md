toolkit
=======

Toolkit is a collection of utility functions writting in Java. 
It currently includes:
- A class that implements singleton objects of BufferedReader and BufferedWritter
- Functions for reading and writing files
- A class that can be used to hold input and output patterns if you are training an Artificial Neural Network
- A class to extract text from PDF files

I still need to write tests!!! Don't judge me   :-(
